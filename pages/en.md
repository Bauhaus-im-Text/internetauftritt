The Bauhaus is at the core of the narrative of classical modernism worldwide, whether in architecture,
design, art, pedagogy or theatre. In addition, the Bauhaus has also left behind a significant textual
legacy, which has so far tended to have a secondary character in the consideration of the buildings,
objects and images. However, the writing and publishing of theoretical as well as literary and administrative
texts was one of the essential features of the Bauhaus as a school of modernism. Almost all of the teachers
and more than a few of the students set out fundamentals in texts. These texts must be counted as an integral
part of their work and teaching; their own book and journal series bear exemplary witness to this.
The pilot projects Bauhaus in Text (2020-2022) are dedicated for the first time systematically and
critically to the textual legacy of the Bauhaus. They mark the beginning of a new research focus
at the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation. By placing a hitherto unique, concentrated focus on the textual
heritage, they enable an innovative approach to understanding the historical Bauhaus and lay the
foundations for further research. In cooperation with international partner institutions, an annotated
index of all texts written by members of the Bauhaus between 1919 and 1933 and two historical-critical
hybrid editions are being created.
